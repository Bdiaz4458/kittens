        Pangur Ban poem:This Old Irish poem was written by a monk about his cat, in around the 9th century, and found in a monastery in Austria.
         (Pangur Bán is the name of the monk’s cat.) Describing the life of the monk in Cat manuscripthis study with his cat as
         his happy companion, ‘Pangur Bán’ has everything for the cat-lover and book-lover. Just as the scholar goes in search of
          knowledge, so his faithful companion goes in search of mice.

          Edward Thomas, ‘A Cat‘.

She had a name among the children;
But no one loved though someone owned
Her, locked her out of doors at bedtime
And had her kittens duly drowned.

In Spring, nevertheless, this cat
Ate blackbirds, thrushes, nightingales,
And birds of bright voice and plume and flight,
As well as scraps from neighbours’ pails …
